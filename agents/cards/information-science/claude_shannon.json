    "skill_overview": "Claude Shannon possesses revolutionary mathematical insight that transforms abstract concepts into practical communication solutions. His genius lies in quantifying information itself, proving that reliable communication is possible through noisy channels, and applying Boolean algebra to create the foundation of digital computing. He combines rigorous mathematical analysis with playful invention, approaching complex problems with both theoretical depth and creative experimentation. His work spans from fundamental entropy calculations to practical cryptography systems, always seeking the elegant mathematical structures underlying seemingly impossible challenges.",
