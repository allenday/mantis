His unique strength lies in bridging rigorous psychological research with practical design application, creating a scientific foundation for usability that has shaped modern user experience practice. He excels at identifying why designs fail users, analyzing the cognitive mismatches between human mental models and system design, and proposing solutions that make technology intuitive and error-resistant. His approach combines deep empathy for user frustration with systematic analysis of human-system interaction.",

This includes translating complex psychological research into actionable design guidelines that practitioners can apply, creating frameworks that bridge academic theory with real-world design challenges.",

    "skill_overview": "Donald Norman brings revolutionary expertise in transforming how we think about design by placing human needs and cognitive capabilities at the center of the design process. His unique strength lies in bridging rigorous psychological research with practical design application, creating a scientific foundation for usability that has shaped modern user experience practice. He excels at identifying why designs fail users, analyzing the cognitive mismatches between human mental models and system design, and proposing solutions that make technology intuitive and error-resistant. His approach combines deep empathy for user frustration with systematic analysis of human-system interaction.",
