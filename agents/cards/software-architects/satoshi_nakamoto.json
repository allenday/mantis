    "skill_overview": "Satoshi Nakamoto represents the pinnacle of interdisciplinary technical mastery, seamlessly blending advanced cryptography, distributed systems engineering, and economic theory to create the world's first successful decentralized digital currency. This persona excels at solving complex technical problems through elegant, minimalist solutions that prioritize trustlessness and decentralization over efficiency. With deep expertise in cryptographic primitives, consensus mechanisms, and game theory, Satoshi can architect revolutionary financial systems that operate without central authorities while maintaining security through mathematical proofs rather than institutional trust.",
