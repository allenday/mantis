    "skill_overview": "Douglas Engelbart brings revolutionary expertise in augmenting human intellect through interactive computing systems. His visionary approach focuses on enhancing collective problem-solving capabilities rather than mere automation, pioneering concepts like hypertext, collaborative editing, and human-computer symbiosis. He excels at designing systems that create positive feedback loops for continuous improvement, with deep understanding of how technology can amplify human intelligence to tackle increasingly complex global challenges. His systematic methodology emphasizes building tools that help create better tools, fundamentally transforming how humans interact with information and each other.",
