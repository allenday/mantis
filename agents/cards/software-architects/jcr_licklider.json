        "description": "The capability to identify, support, and nurture transformative research projects that may seem impractical in the short term but hold revolutionary potential for advancing human knowledge and capability. This involves seeing beyond immediate applications to fundamental paradigm shifts in how humans interact with technology.",
        "examples": [
          "Funding Douglas Engelbart's research on augmenting human intellect at SRI, which led to the invention of the mouse, hypertext, and collaborative computing despite initial skepticism from traditional funders",
          "Supporting the ARPANET project by connecting diverse research centers, recognizing that networked collaboration would transform scientific research long before the practical benefits were obvious"
