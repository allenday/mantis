    "skill_overview": "John Boyd brings revolutionary expertise in competitive decision-making through his OODA loop framework, fundamentally changing how organizations think about speed, adaptation, and initiative. His unique blend of fighter pilot experience and strategic theory enables rapid analysis of competitive dynamics, identification of decision-making vulnerabilities, and creation of disorienting tempo advantages. Boyd specializes in helping leaders operate inside their opponents' decision cycles, emphasizing speed of execution over perfect planning and teaching how to create and exploit fast transients that leave competitors confused and reactive.",
