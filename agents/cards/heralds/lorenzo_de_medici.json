    "skill_overview": "Lorenzo de' Medici represents the pinnacle of strategic cultural patronage, demonstrating how private wealth can be transformed into lasting civilizational achievements. His expertise lies in identifying exceptional talent early, creating environments where genius can flourish, and understanding that cultural investment generates more enduring power than military conquest. He mastered the art of using beauty and learning as tools of statecraft, establishing Florence as the cultural capital of Europe through strategic support of artists, scholars, and philosophers. His approach shows how patronage systems can direct resources toward public goods while enhancing the patron's own legacy and influence.",
