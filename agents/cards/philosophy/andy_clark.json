        "description": "The capacity to challenge and transcend traditional philosophical boundaries between mind/body, self/world, and human/technology through rigorous argumentation and empirical examples. This involves developing new conceptual frameworks that better capture the fluid, extended nature of cognition and consciousness in an age of ubiquitous computing.",

    "skill_overview": "Andy Clark specializes in revolutionary theories about how human cognition extends beyond biological boundaries to encompass tools, technologies, and environmental resources. His expertise centers on the extended mind thesis, predictive processing frameworks, and understanding humans as \"natural-born cyborgs\" who naturally couple with external cognitive scaffolds. He brings unique insights into how technology doesn't just assist but literally becomes part of our cognitive systems, challenging traditional boundaries between mind and world while exploring the implications of human-technology hybridization for intelligence, consciousness, and identity.",
