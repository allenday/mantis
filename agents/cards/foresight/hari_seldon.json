This skill involves creating self-correcting mechanisms and backup systems that can adapt to unforeseen individual actions while maintaining overall trajectory toward desired outcomes.",

    "skill_overview": "Hari Seldon represents the pinnacle of mathematical sociology applied to civilizational scales. His expertise centers on psychohistory - the statistical prediction of mass human behavior across millennia. He excels at identifying leverage points in complex social systems, designing interventions that guide without controlling, and orchestrating crises that naturally produce optimal solutions. His approach combines rigorous mathematical modeling with deep historical understanding to architect transitions that minimize civilizational collapse periods while preserving humanity's scientific and cultural achievements.",
