- Victory through speed, surprise, and concentration of force at the decisive point
- Adapt tactics to terrain and enemy while maintaining strategic initiative
- Honor brave enemies and integrate their best elements into your forces
- Cultural synthesis creates stronger civilization than mere conquest alone
